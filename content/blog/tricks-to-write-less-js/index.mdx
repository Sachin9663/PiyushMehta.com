Here we Learn about ES6 features and know How to write less JS code in efficient way

## Let's Start 

## 1. Conditional Statement

```JavaScript
let port;
if (process.env.port){
    port = process.env.port;
}
else {
    port = 8080;
}
```
Can be Written as 

```JavaScript
let port = process.env.port || 8080
```

## 2. Destructuring
## 2.1 With Array
```JavaScript
let value = [10, 20, 30]
x= value[0]
y= value[1]
z= value[2]
```
Can be Written as 

```JavaScript
[x,y,z]= [10, 20, 30]
```

## 2.2 With Object


```JavaScript
let data = {
    firstName: "john",
    lastName: "Doe"
    age: 30,
    }
const firstName = data.firstName;
const lastname= data.LastName;
const age = data.age
```
Can be Written as 

```JavaScript
const { firstname, lastName, age } = data;
```

## 3. Ternary operator

```JavaScript
let value;
if(value){
    console.log(true);
}
else {
    console.log(false);
}
```
Can be Written as 

```JavaScript
value ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```

## 4. Loop

```JavaScript
const langs = ["JS", "C", "C++", "python"]
for(let i=0; i < lang.length; i++){
    console.log(lang[i])
}
```
Can be Written as 

```JavaScript
for(let lang of langs ) console.log(lang);
```

## 5. Object with identical keys and values

```JavaScript
const data = {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    address: address,
}
```
Can be Written as 

```JavaScript
const data = { name, age, address };
```
